# Physically-based-modelling
This repository is a set of physics simulation projects developed as a part of CSCE 649: Physically-Based Modeling.

## Stable Fluids Simulation

2D fluid simulation using semi-lagrangian method and staggered grid for velocity interpolation. I have used conjugate gradient method with implicit matrix representation to solve for the field variables.

## Deformable Springy-Mesh Simulation
<img src="Gifs/Spring2.gif">
Springy mesh is basically consrtucted by replacing the edges with a spring-mass-damper system. In this simulation, I tried modeling a cloth (in the absense of gravity of-course). The close is basically modelled as a lattice of quadrilaterals with additional reinforcing structs for in-plane and out-of-plane rigidity. A simplefied collision detection and response is simulated with a sphere.

## Rigid Body Simulation

Simulation of a cuboid bouncing inside a Dodecahedron. Representation of the orientation of the rigid body is done using quarernions. Forgive my bad rendering skills.

## Flocking

Group behaviour of a flock of birds or school of fish, or insects is fascinating. However, it is interesting modeling the same turns to be very simple. Every individual follows a set of three simple rules guiding how it accelerates in response to the positions and velocities of its nearby neighbor individuals. The rules are (1) Collision Avoidance, (2) Velocity Matching, (3) Centering

This simulation also shows the 'boids' steering around obstacles.

<img src="Gifs/Spiral.gif">
This is a fun little game I created. The goal is to use the lead particle (colored red, controlled by keys) to direct the impatient insect group to the center of the spiral.

## Fireworks

A simple 3D particle animation with gravity and colors.

## Ball Collision
<img src="Gifs/Collision.gif">
This is the basic simulation - the ball is represented simply by its position. Collision detection and response are implemented. Gravity can be enabled/disabled. Wind can be controlled using keys.
